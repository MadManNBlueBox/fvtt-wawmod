For wizards in the UK, Beauxbatons is most notable for its friendly rivalry to British Magical School, and the two schools have often supported each other throughout history. Beauxbatons is widely recognized for the elegance of its castle, its majestic gardens and its well-prepared cuisine.</p>\n<h2>Tradition and Discipline</h2>\n<p>Etiquette and respect are at the forefront of Beauxbatons customs. The students stand at attention whenever their headmaster or headmistress enters a room and continue doing so until they take a seat or order everyone to return to their tasks.</p>\n<p>There is a strong atmosphere of school pride, and the Academy's traditions are treasured by staff and students alike. While taught to be polite, that pride often shows through when students of Beauxbatons travel abroad.</p>\n<h2>A Delicate Approach to Magic</h2>\n<p>Beauxbatons Academy of Magic teaches its students to approach magic with control and finesse, instead of clumsiness or brute force. The studies revolve around proper dueling forms, taxonomies and knowledge deeply grounded in magical theory.</p>\n<p>To an untrained eye, the deliberate movements of Beauxbatons duelists might resemble a choreographed dance, but it's closer to the precision, quickness and lethality of Muggle fencing.</p>\n<h2>Beauxbatons Student Traits</h2>\n<p>The traits of Beauxbatons students originate from their school's dueling style and from their travels abroad.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Dexterity score, Wisdom score, and one other ability score of choice increase by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Nimble Evasion.</strong> Whenever you take the dodge action, add half your proficiency modifier to your AC and your Dexterity saving throws.</p>\n<p><strong>Exchange Student.</strong> You're familiar with the workings of the International Confederation of Wizards and other international associations.</p>\n<p><strong>Feat.</strong> You gain one feat of your choice.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"W&W p.6","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Beauxbatons","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/beam-sky-1.jpg","_id":"QhfSxWn2Qn6dhWyM"}

Although they go about it differently, a Eagle can be just as morally motivated as a Lion.</p>\n<h2>Contingency Planners</h2>\n<p>Eagles plan. They collect information, they strategize. They have tools. They run hypotheticals and try to plan ahead for things that might come up. They build things (of varying degrees of actual usefulness) that they can use later, whether that’s an emergency supply pack or vast knowledge in a niche topic.

Historically, Durmstrang has also refused to accept Muggleborn students, although that might be attributed to a previous headmaster's association with Britain's Death Eaters. Its modern policies are unknown.</p>\n<h2>Unorthodox Curriculum</h2>\n<p>Durmstrang is notorious for its acceptance of the Dark Arts, and was known to have educated (and later expelled) Gellert Grindelwald before his ascension as one of history's most dangerous Dark wizards.</p>\n<p>Contrary to its reputation, Durmstrang doesn't specialize in the Dark Arts themselves, but in combative magic. The school is simply open-minded about the use of Dark Arts, and so most topics studied at Durmstrang incorporate Dark elements other schools would forswear.</p>\n<h2>Strength Through Hardship</h2>\n<p>The stern and militaristic culture that has pervaded the Durmstrang Institute is mirrored in its harsh surroundings. Brutal winters, rigorous physical exercise regimens and swimming in ice cold lakes are all part of the character-building school experience.</p>\n<p>Although some parents feel the approach is too extreme, everything is designed to produce resilient and resourceful wizards and witches who will survive any combat.</p>\n<h2>Durmstrang Student Traits</h2>\n<p>The Durmstrang coursework and philosophy strongly define its students' traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong>&nbsp;Your Strength score,&nbsp;Constitution score, and&nbsp;one other ability score of&nbsp;choice increase by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Cold Efficiency.</strong> You&nbsp;add the <em>bombarda </em>spell&nbsp;to your list of known spells.&nbsp;It does not count against&nbsp;your cantrips known, and&nbsp;cannot be forgotten to learn&nbsp;another cantrip.</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Education.</strong> You have&nbsp;advantage on any rolls made to&nbsp;resist gaining Corruption effects&nbsp;from Dark magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Feat.</strong> You gain one feat of your choice.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"W&Wp.6","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Durmstrang","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/beam-royal-1.jpg","_id":"j8grmHzhR0GoCSw8"}

They value fairness because everyone is a person. Even directly wronged, Badgers will often give a second (or fifth) chance.</p>\n<p>But Badgers aren't inherently tolerant, like Lions aren't inherently moral.
